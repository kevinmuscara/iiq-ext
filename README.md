## Roadmap

- **Pinned Header**: Keep asset/user header details pinned to the top view of the page so when scrolling, you can still see vital information.

- **Hover Ticket Preview**: On an asset detail page, hover over the "1 open ticket" text to show a preview of the most recent submitted ticket so that you don't have to load an entire new page

- **Duplicate Entry Alert**: When searching and more than one matching entry shows up, a warning box will appear for you to proceed with caution.

- **Custom Device Replacement Process**: Custom modal for when a device needs exchanged without attaching the old/previous ticket onto the new device. (automatically unassigns and assigns old/new device)
